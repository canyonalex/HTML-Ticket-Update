  <!-- comment: Use the hidden variable 'search' for any additional search criteria.

	 The criteria that are added must be a valid SQL statement or part of a statement that can
	 be added to whatever Theatre Manager starts with.  Your statement will be added with an  'and' condition 
	 
	 Sample usage of this extra parameter are:

		Sample 1: Using the Performance flag to find out which performances match a particular letter
		
			  <select name="search" id="search">
					 <option value="">&lt;any kind&gt;</option>
					 <option value="PB_PERF_FLAG='C'">Comedy</option>
					 <option value="PB_PERF_FLAG='D'">Drama</option>
					 <option value="PB_PERF_FLAG in('C','D')">Comedy or Drama</option>
					  </select> 
					  
		Sample 2: Using the contents of play notes to see if a particular word  is in it
		
			  <select name="search" id="search">
					 <option value="">&lt;any kind&gt;</option>
					 <option value="P_SALES_NOTES like '%comedy%'">Comedy</option>
					 <option value="P_SALES_NOTES like '%drama%'">Drama</option>
					  </select>
		
		Sample 3: using search from outside the event page to limit to certain items.   Note:  you must
				provide the parameter event=0 to access all events that match the search - and so
				Theatre Manager knows what you want to find because the search could apply to donations,
				gift certificates, etc.  Please refer to
