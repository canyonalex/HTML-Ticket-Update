  <!-- ASSET LOADING -->
  <!-- comment: The web templates have a number of code and style dependencies.  How
                those dependencies are loaded can have performance and security 
                implications.  To help make those trade-offs more clear, you may select
                from the asset loading strategies below  

    STRATEGY 1: Use files server from the local web server only.  This strategy is good for 
                sites that want 100% certainty that all files are the corect version and that those
                files do not include any malicious content, but at the expense of higher bandwidth usage.

       INCLUDE: tmScripts/stylesLocal.html 
    

    STRATEGY 2: Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) with Sub-Resource Integrity (SRI) hashing.  
                This strategy is good for a low-bandwidth internet connection, or a sales pattern
                that could include very high traffic spikes of new users.  This strategy outsources 
                all asset requests to an external Content Delivery Network (CDN) that will likely have 
                web servers that are both faster, and potentially physically closer to the user.
