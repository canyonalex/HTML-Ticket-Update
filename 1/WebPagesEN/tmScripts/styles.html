  <!-- ASSET LOADING -->
  <!-- comment: The web templates have a number of code and style dependencies.  How
                those dependencies are loaded can have performance and security 
                implications.  To help make those trade-offs more clear, you may select
                from the asset loading strategies below  

                If using Sub-Resource Integrity (SRI), hashes can be generated with the following openssl command:

                    $ openssl dgst -sha384 -binary jquery-2.2.4.min.js | openssl base64 -A
                    rY/jv8mMhqDabXSo+UCggqKtdmBfd3qC2/KvyTDNQ6PcUJXaxK1tMepoQda4g5vB

                Alternatively you can use:

                   https://www.srihash.org/

                Copy and paste the hash, prefixed by the hash method (sha384) and a hyphen, into the link:

                  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js" integrity="sha384-rY/jv8mMhqDabXSo+UCggqKtdmBfd3qC2/KvyTDNQ6PcUJXaxK1tMepoQda4g5vB" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>


                Only one strategy may be used at a time.


    STRATEGY 1: Use CDN only (with Sub-Resource Integrity (SRI) hashing).  This strategy
                is good for a low-bandwidth internet connections.  It outsources all
                requests to an external Content Delivery Network (CDN).

    STRATEGY 2: Use local files only.  This strategy is good for sites that want 100%
                certainty that all files are the corect version and do not include
                any malicious content, but at the expense of higher bandwidth usage.
