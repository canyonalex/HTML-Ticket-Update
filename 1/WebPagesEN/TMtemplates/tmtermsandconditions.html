          Accessible Seating
          <br/>
         </b>
         If your ticket purchase includes seating designated as accessible (generally set aside for patrons under the Americans with Disabilities Act), you may be greeted by ushers near the seating area.  If it is more appropriate to seat you elsewhere for any reason, you explicitly accept that you and your entire party may be reseated at the sole discretion of the venue into seats of our choosing and subject to availability on that performance.
        </p>

          Scalping, Secondary Market, or Problem Orders
         </b>
         <br/>
         In the interest of preserving affordable ticket prices for all patrons:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          We are not responsible for tickets purchased through unauthorized third parties.
         </li>
         <li>
          We reserve the right to refuse to sell tickets to identified ticket brokers and scalpers.
         </li>
         <li>
          We reserve the right to revoke any tickets sold to identified ticket brokers and scalpers through a full refund at face value.
         </li>
         <li>
          Anyone holding a revoked ticket will not be allowed in the theatre.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         This will be specifically enforced if you have any past history of disputing any sale.
