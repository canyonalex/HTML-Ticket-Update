We reserve the right to cancel your ticket purchase at any time and for any reason if we determine that there is a potential issue with your order or a risk to the venue (including but not limited to financial, reputation or any other reason).   Tickets cancelled by the venue more than 7 days prior to the performance will receive a full refund for the tickets.
