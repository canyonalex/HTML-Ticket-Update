      Accessible Seating

     <p>
      If your ticket purchase includes seating designated as accessible (generally set aside for patrons under the Americans with Disabilities Act), you may be greeted by ushers near the seating area.  If it is more appropriate to seat you elsewhere for any reason, you explicitly accept that you and your entire party may be reseated at the sole discretion of the venue into seats of our choosing and subject to availability on that performance.

     <p>
      We do not make tickets available to scalpers or the secondary market.  We reserve the right to cancel your ticket purchase at any time and for any reason if we determine that there is a potential issue with your order or a risk to the venue (including but not limited to financial, reputation or any other reason).   Tickets cancelled by the venue more than 7 days prior to the performance will receive a full refund for the tickets.
     </p>
     <p>
      This will be specifically enforced if you have any past history of disputing any sale.
