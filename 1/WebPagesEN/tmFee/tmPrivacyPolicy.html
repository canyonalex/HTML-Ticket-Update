    <div class="alert alert-warning">
     Credit card data in our database conforms to the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council
     (PCI SSC) Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA-DSS) v3.1 requirements from the credit
     card industry. That means we do not store data from credit card transactions such as Track II or 
	CVV2/CID (the 3 or 4 digits on the back of the card).  If stored, credit card numbers are securely 
     encrypted and we ask that you never send a complete number to us in an email.
     <p>
      &nbsp;
     </p>
     PCI compliance means that our database and key internal applications have been tested for 
    security by independant 3rd party auditors and approved by the PCI council.
