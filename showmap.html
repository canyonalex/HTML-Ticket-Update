  <!-- replace tickets.yourvenue.org with your web ticketing url.

	This will refresh the stats every five seconds into an iFrame in the page.  If you want to change the
	refresh rate, change the neta tag where it says CONTENT="5" above to some other value.  Time is in seconds.
	
	THIS IS A CONCEPT ONLY ...  you may need to play with parameters and other settings in your browser and
	change the TM_SEQ= and PMB_SEQ= to work for your current upcoming show.
